# Fault detection and diagnosis using machine learning

This repository contains the libraries and scripts developed by the ES721-2022 group at AAU during the 1st semester of the Electronic Systems Master's program.

The purpose of the project is to use common machine learning tools such as linear dimensionality reduction (PCA & LDA) and simply classifiers (LDA, QDA & SVM) to detect and classify faults in a refrigeration system.

### Various libraries
- [LDA for dimensionality reduction and classification](Python/lda.py)
- [QDA for classification](Python/qda.py)
- [Scaler for zero mean and unit variance](Python/standardization.py)

### Pre-processors
- [Data extraction from default format](/DataProcessing/data_extractor.ipynb)
- [Data random subsampler](/DataProcessing/zahra_processor.ipynb)
